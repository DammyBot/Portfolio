Users can enter a task into an input field, add it to the list, and mark it as completed using a checkbox, which moves it to a separate completed section. Tasks remain stored even after refreshing the page, as every addition, completion, or deletion dynamically updates localStorage. Built using HTML, CSS (optional for styling), and JavaScript, this project demonstrates event handling and data persistence techniques.",
